          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.

          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
          imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
          generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
          beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal
          education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the
          Middle Kingdom.[2] Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the
          Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607 Plato founded
          the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
          Europe.

          Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught the three
          Rs (of reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and
          geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most
          places. After the Civil War (1861â€“1865), the cities began building
          high schools. The South was far behind northern standards on every
          educational measure and gave weak support to its segregated all-black
          schools.

          Colonial New England encouraged its towns to support free public
          schools funded by taxation. In the early 19th century Massachusetts
          took the lead in education reform and public education with programs
          designed by Horace Mann that were widely emulated across the North.
