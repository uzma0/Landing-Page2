          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education
          can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that
          has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy.

          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
          imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
          generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
          beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal
          education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the
          Middle Kingdom.[2] Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the
          Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607 Plato founded
          the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
          Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE,
          became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
          Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd
          century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy
          and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4] In China,
          Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most
          influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues
          to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan,
          and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a
          ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects
          were written down by followers and have continued to influence
          education in East Asia into the modern era.[5]

          Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught the three
          Rs (of reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and
          geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most
          places. After the Civil War (1861–1865), the cities began building
          high schools. The South was far behind northern standards on every
          educational measure and gave weak support to its segregated all-black
          schools. However northern philanthropy and northern churches provided
          assistance to private black colleges across the South. Religious
          denominations across the country set up their private colleges. States
          also opened state universities, but they were quite small until well
          into the 20th century

          Colonial New England encouraged its towns to support free public
          schools funded by taxation. In the early 19th century Massachusetts
          took the lead in education reform and public education with programs
          designed by Horace Mann that were widely emulated across the North.
